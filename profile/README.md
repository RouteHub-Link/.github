# Route Hub

## Overview
Route Hub is a platform that elevates link routing to a new level of functionality and customization. It adopts a B2B approach and caters to various users, such as social media content creators, e-commerce website owners, or private companies.

Users can register as company members and publish their hubs on their own domains. They can also edit their hubs as they wish. They can either shorten their existing links or create new ones from scratch. The key feature is that these links are SEO-friendly and crawlable. Moreover, users can modify the behavior of the end users who click on their links. For example, they can redirect them directly, or ask them a question before redirecting them. This way, they can increase the engagement and retention of their visitors, and also showcase their organization better.

In short, Route Hub enables users to have personalized hubs with shortened links that reflect their organization and create projects for each domain with a customizable design. The main benefit is that whenever someone clicks on their link, whether they want to be redirected or not, they will have the opportunity to learn more about the user's organization and explore their other links.

That's what Route Hub offers.
